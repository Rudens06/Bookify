    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      Welcome to our experimental project. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information. This document outlines how we handle your data and the limitations of this experimental platform.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Data Collection</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This platform collects minimal data necessary for its operation. Examples of data we may collect include non-sensitive information like your name or email address, if provided during interactions. However, as this is an experimental project, we strongly advise against submitting sensitive or confidential information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Purpose of the Project</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This platform is purely experimental and is not designed for commercial or production use. The primary purpose is to test and demonstrate functionalities. Data submitted may be stored temporarily and used solely for improving and evaluating this experimental system.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">No Guarantee of Data Security</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      While we strive to ensure data security, this platform is experimental and lacks the robust security measures of a production-grade system. As such, we cannot guarantee the protection of data submitted to this platform. Please refrain from sharing sensitive, financial, or personal information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Temporary Data Storage</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Any data submitted may be stored temporarily for testing purposes. We aim to periodically delete all stored data, but due to the experimental nature of the platform, complete data removal cannot be guaranteed. By using this platform, you acknowledge this limitation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This project may use third-party services to enhance functionality. These services may collect data per their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the data practices of these third-party providers, and we recommend reviewing their privacy policies for more information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This privacy policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the platform or its usage. Any updates will be posted on this page, and we encourage users to review it regularly.
    </p>
